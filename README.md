## Project Overview

The project is designed to showcase the use of JavaScript to create a message generator. It demonstrates basic concepts such as arrays, randomization, and string concatenation.

## How It Works

The program uses three arrays—adjectives, verbs, and nouns—to construct a random message. The `generateRandomMessage` function selects a random element from each array and combines them into a complete message.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/javascript-mixed-messages.git

## Usage

node messageGenerator.js


## Customization

Feel free to customize the arrays in messageGenerator.js to add your own elements or modify the structure of the messages. You can also implement additional features or improve the randomization algorithm.
